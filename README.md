# DesignPatterns
Exercise and describe design patterns
In this repository, I want to teach and practice the concepts of patterns in the form of examples.

# Creational Pattern
Creational Design Patterns focus on the process of object creation or problems related to object creation. They help in making a system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented. Creational patterns give a lot of flexibility in what gets created, who creates it, and how it gets created.
## Key Benefits:
* Decoupling: It decouples the code that uses the objects from the code that creates the objects.
* Flexibility: It makes it easier to introduce new types of objects without changing the code that uses them.
## Factory Method
The Factory Design Pattern defines an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This pattern delegates the responsibility of instantiating objects to a factory class, which makes the code more flexible and easier to manage.
